Overhauls:
- UI (doesn't work on other scenes at the moment)

Bugfixes:
- I think this one is obvious

Changes:
- Replaced Bimbonumulous as Rinolit (credit to rinolit_2 for the model)
- Mr. Gold locks the door after leaving his office. Also, he can approach to the door and unlock it after getting too many warnings (only if the door is still locked)
- NPCs can open the doors for a split second while being locked
- Improved triggers for openable doors, so it makes NPCs open the doors easier

Additionals:
- Sprite now bounces once it hits Josh


Yeah umm... I don't quite remember what else I added, so you'll have to find out yourself I guess.
