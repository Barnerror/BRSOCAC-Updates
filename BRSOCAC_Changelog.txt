Optimizations:

- Redone the yellow tile floor texture *(Planned)
- Redone the USB stick item texture
- Redone the door trigger for NPCs

- Mr. Gold now runs away from the school upon getting the final warning during practice mode *(Planned)

- Sprite, Pezi and The Golden Broom can push balloons *(Planned)
- Pezi now has an alternative item use (works the same as Sprite, but can do more) *(Planned)

- Added an ability where you can store your items in cabinets *(Planned)
- Mr. Anonymous can approach, pickup and throw projectiles at you
- Mr. Anonymous doesn't kill you if he has a shield on, but he will drain some of your health instead

- Added a name entry screen *(Planned)
- Added alternative item uses *(Planned)
- Added an announcements screen. Useful for upcoming game update statuses in the future *(Planned)
- Added a visual effect when you sprint while Pezi is active
- Hiding in vents are now more useless in Mr. Anonymous' Challenge, which means an entity can open the vent (the one you're hiding in) and catch you *(Planned)
- Hiding in vents require you to hold a button to hide
- Balloons leave a behind on the ground once they're popped *(Planned)
- Added a little secret in practice mode

Bugfixes:

- Changed the fade out screen in Mr. Anonymous' challenge phase 1 ending, so it's better

- A different music plays and a voiceline when getting all questions wrong
- Balloons now have an item inside once the balloons are with a sign "?", but it's rare to find *(Planned)
